# Multi-scale-Multimodal-Cross-Attention-for-Seizure-Detection
### Model 1 features 
* CNN-Multiscale multimodalities
* weighted sum cls token fusion on long and short data 
* weighted sum original embedding and transformed embedding on long and short data 
* cross attention is done on the new cls token and the new embeddings
